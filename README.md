Project Overview ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

# It is a versatile recipe application available on both web and mobile platforms. Users can easily search for recipes using keywords, ingredients, or categories, and access detailed information such as ingredients, instructions, and nutritional facts for each recipe.The application seamlessly integrates with an external API, such as Edamam, to fetch a wide variety of recipes, ensuring a diverse selection for users to explore.With responsive design on the web and native features on the mobile app, It provides a convenient and enjoyable solution for users to discover and prepare delicious meals.


SET UP AND INSTALLATIONS ------------------------

Setting up the Web Application:

Clone the Repository:
# First, you'll need to clone the repository to your local machine. You can do this by using Git to clone the repository or by downloading the ZIP file from the repository page on GitHub.

Install Dependencies:
# Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt and run the command npm install to install all the necessary dependencies required for the web application.

Configure API Keys:
# Obtain API keys from a recipe API provider such as Edamam. Replace the placeholder API keys in the project files with your actual API keys. This step ensures that the web application can fetch recipe data from the API.

Run the Application:
# After installing the dependencies and configuring the API keys, you can start the development server by running the command npm start in your terminal. This will launch the web application in your default web browser.

Explore and Test:
# Once the application is running, you can explore its features, search for recipes, and test all functionalities to ensure everything is working as expected.

Setting up the Mobile Application (React Native):

Clone the Repository:
# Similarly, clone the repository to your local machine if you haven't already done so.

Install Dependencies:
# Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt and run the command npm install to install all the necessary dependencies required for the mobile application.

Configure API Keys:
# Obtain API keys from your chosen recipe API provider and replace the placeholder keys in the project files with your actual API keys. This step ensures that the mobile application can fetch recipe data from the API.

Run the Application:
# Connect a compatible emulator or physical device to your development environment. Then, run npm run android or npm run ios in your terminal to build and launch the mobile app on the chosen platform.

Test on Emulator/Device:
# Once the mobile app is running, you can interact with it on the emulator or physical device. Test various features such as recipe search, favorite marking, and navigation to ensure smooth functionality.

FEATURE LIST ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RECIPE SEARCH 
# Description: Users can search for recipes based on keywords, ingredients, or categories.
# Use Case: Users can easily find recipes for specific dishes or ingredients they have on hand.

RECIPE DETAILS
# Description: Detailed information about each recipe including ingredients, instructions, cooking time, serving size, and nutritional information.
# Use Case: Users can view comprehensive details about a recipe to decide if they want to try it out.

RESPONSIVE DESIGN
# Description: The web application is designed to be responsive, providing a consistent user experience across different screen sizes and devices.
# Use Case: Responsive design ensures that users can access Recipe from various devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones, without compromising usability or functionality.

DATA REFRESH
# Description: Data Refresh functionality allows the application to update and refresh its content from external sources, such as recipe APIs or user-generated content, to ensure that users are always provided with the latest information.
# Use Case: Data Refresh ensures that users have access to up-to-date recipes, ingredients, nutritional information, and other relevant data. It may be triggered manually by users or scheduled to occur automatically at regular intervals to keep the application's content current.

MOBILE FEATURES
# Description: In the mobile app version, native device features such as camera access (for scanning ingredients), push notifications, and offline support may be leveraged.
# Use Case: By utilizing native features, the mobile app can offer additional functionalities and provide a seamless user experience tailored to the capabilities of the user's device.


TEST SUITE AND CODE COVERAGE REPORT ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# We have developed a comprehensive test suite to ensure the reliability and functionality . The test suite covers various aspects of the application, including component rendering, API integration, and user interactions. We use Jest, a popular testing framework for React applications, to run our test suite and collect code coverage data. Jest automatically generates a code coverage report, which provides insights into the percentage of code covered by our tests. By regularly running our test suite and reviewing the code coverage report, we ensure the quality and stability .

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
